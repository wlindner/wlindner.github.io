It started out as Instanear and at first only showed photos tagged close by. Eventually I added top locations to search, searching anywhere in the world and even saving your favorite spots so you can revisit them. Earlier this year Instagram added most of this same functionality to their own app. This is kind of like what happened when I made ApartmentsNearMetro.com, but instead of Instagram blocking me (like Craigslist did) there&#39;s just no reason to use Spotsy when those features are already built into the Instagram app.</p><p>I sort of suspected something might be up when Instagram started changing their APIs to no longer rely on Foursquare for their location data. Ya see, when Instagram first launched, before Facebook bought them, they used Foursquare to get the names of locations when you tagged a photo at a place. After Facebook bought them, I suspect they realized that they were kind of giving a lot of relevant information to Foursquare. Hell, maybe this was a big part of why Facebook bought them. Foursquare knew the places people were tagging photos and that information could be used to improve Foursquare&#39;s own services. Plus, I bet Instagram had to pay to use Foursquare&#39;s APIs. Facebook has always been pretty bad about location data, but using Instagram&#39;s data to augment Facebook Places means more and more relevant information about where people are going and what places exist. Who knows, maybe Facebook is even analyzing those Instagram images that are tagged at those Facebook places to find out even more about us.</p><p>Overal, I&#39;m really happy with the new functionality in the Instagram app, here are the things I like: * It&#39;s integrated into the app. You can&#39;t really get much better than that. Just keep using the Instagram app, go to the explore tab and you can search for a location, or navigate the big banner at the top that changes periodically with interesting themes. * Trending locations. I like how they did this too. If you scroll through the banner at the top of the Explore tab you can see one for Trending locations. I&#39;ve noticed that the first few seem to be close by locations that are trending and as you keep going down the list they get more and more universal. This is smart. Spotsy always had a problem with nearby searching in locations that just don&#39;t have anything going on and I always wanted to add Trending locations, but didn&#39;t really have the data volume for it to be interesting. * Location and People Exploring is blended. They kind of seamlessly mixed together the interface for exploring people and locations. Spotsy was almost exclusively focused on location, but I think it&#39;s a key element of Instagram&#39;s success to think about exploring to find new people to follow, not just thinking about photos from the perspective of where they were taken.</p><p>I think in general the purpose of this is to augment Facebook&#39;s location data. Facebook released this page: https://www.facebook.com/places a while ago, and now that all that Instagram and Facebook location data is working together I think Facebook is going to get a lot better at understanding location data. Things like finding a good place to eat or a museum your friends like will become a lot better because you&#39;ll know if your friends tagged photos there, checked in on facebook, took photos of food there. All sorts of things that Facebook can do now that all those photos you tag are integrated with Facebook places.</p><p>As for me, it&#39;s kind of a relief. It feels good to realize I thought up and implemented an idea that became a feature of one of the most popular social networks today. I always enjoyed working on Spotsy, but I knew it wasn&#39;t something I wanted to keep going forever. It was a great challenge to learn the iOS APIs, Instagram APIs, Foursquare APIs and Objective-C. I loved getting to go deep on interaction and animation that works so well on the native iOS platform. Spotsy was always a part time side project, but I&#39;m also transitioning out of my full time job at Zoomdata, and I&#39;m looking for a new opportunity. I think this whole experience gave me another perspective on what I like and don&#39;t like about building and launching products. It gives me great hope for the future and I don&#39;t regret anything about the experience. If you have an idea, go for it, you never know what you&#39;ll learn.</p></div><div id=comments><h1>Comments</h1><br><div id=disqus_thread></div><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></div></div><footer><div class=center><div class="contact left"><p><a target=_blank href=mailto:wlindner522@gmail.com>Â© 2015 William Lindner</a></p></div><div class="contact right"><p><a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/wlindner>Twitter</a> | <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/wlindner>Github</a> | <a target=_blank href=https://linkedin.com/in/wlindner>Linkedin</a></p></div></div></footer></div><!-- Dummy #disqus_thread to keep embed.js from Disqus from complaining --><div id=disqus_thread style="display: none"></div><script src=/js/vendor.d41d.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
