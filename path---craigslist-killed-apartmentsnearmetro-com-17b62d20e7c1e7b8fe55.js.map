During the summer of 2011 I had the unfortunate experience of needing to find a place to live in Northern Virginia.  My roommate and I agreed that our main requirements were 2 bedrooms, within our price range, and it had to be close to the metro.  Every day I would open up Craigslist.org, run a search, open all the listings that looked interesting and check them on Google Maps.  I knew there had to be a simpler way.</p>\\n<p>I wrote a simple python script in a few hours that scraped Craigslist’s Washington DC apartment listings.  After that, it checked if it had a Google Maps link.  If it did, it would then passed it through the <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix/\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Google Maps Distance Matrix API</a>.  Then, Google told me how many minutes it would take to walk from that apartment listing to any of the metro stations I was interested in.  If the apartment fit my criteria, I would get an email within a couple minutes of the listing being posted.  It was a success and inevitably lead to my roommate and I finding a great apartment.</p>\\n<p>Once I proved it worked, I knew it could help other people as well.  I originally wrote the script in <a href=\\\"http://python.org\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Python</a> so I decided to try to build a web application using <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Google App Engine</a>.  I was very happy with the power of GAE and was able to get a functioning application running hosted in GAE.  Unfortunately, at the time, I had no idea just how little I knew about UI/UX or creative design.  Fortunately, my good friend <a href=\\\"http://alexsailer.com/\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Alex Sailer</a>, agreed to help design the application.

Had around 1,500 unique visitors with an average time spent on the site of about 7 and a half minutes.
